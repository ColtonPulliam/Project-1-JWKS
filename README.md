# Project-1-JWKS

I used python, which is an easy to read language, but because UNT primarily teaches C/C++, I have never used it before. Alot of the code for my project came from just reading one step of the poject at a time, reading or watching a tutorial about this step, implementing it into my code, and combining it until it all worked together.
