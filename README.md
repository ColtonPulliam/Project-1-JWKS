# Project-1-JWKS

I used python, which is an easy to read language, but because UNT primarily teaches C/C++, I have never used it before. The intial code for my project came from just reading one step of the project at a time, reading or watching a tutorial about this step, implementing it into my code, and combining it. Eventually when I began testing with Gradebot, I had to alter my code pretty significantly with the help recieved in the recitiation. Sadly, I was not able to complete a fully working test suite by the time this was due as it is something I've never done before and I'm not sure what it is fully supposed to encompass.
