# Project-2-Extending JWKS

For this project, I used the provided program 1 code along with the provided table schema and create an sqlite database that gradebot can use to test the program. I watched this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byHcYRpMgI4&t=1173s to implement the database. Read code comments for specifc details

To run:
main python.py

For test suite:
python -m coverage run TestSuite.py
python -m coverage report

It is worth noting that because of the size of the code plus it not being my own originally, I could not get overall coverage over 62%
